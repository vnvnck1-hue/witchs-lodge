Use case: style-transfer.
Asset: ONE production transparent-alpha HALF-BODY character portrait for Witch's Lodge.
Input 1 is this character's existing IDENTITY reference. Preserve THAT person's recognizable face, age, complexion, hair, expression, clothing colors and signature props. Input 2 is APPROVED BRAM V02: match its bold card-illustration style AND its complete, uncropped half-body composition with deliberate lower finish. Input 3 is the APPROVED NIB CHARACTER CARD: drawing style only, not goblin identity or card frame.

Redraw the input-1 character using thick tapered BLACK INK contours, strong internal ink shapes, large painted color planes, expressive lightly exaggerated adult features, decisive two/three-value shadows and restrained printed gouache/dry-brush texture, like input 2 and the artwork inside input 3. Make it look drawn by the same card illustrator. No realistic 3D shading, glossy airbrush or dense microtexture.

COMPOSITION IS CRITICAL: upright 4:5, ideally 1122x1402. Head to waist half-body, including COMPLETE shoulders, BOTH elbows, forearms and hands where visible. All hair, hat, clothes, arms and props must fit inside the canvas. Leave at least 6 percent genuinely transparent breathing room on ALL FOUR sides of the ENTIRE illustration, including below the lowest painted edge. Zoom out and reconstruct any anatomy missing in input 1. Nothing can touch or be chopped off by the rectangular canvas. Don't simply pad an already cropped portrait.
Finish lower torso below waist with a gently irregular curved hand-painted vignette edge, like Bram v02, fully surrounded by alpha; no hard straight horizontal crop, no severed arms. No legs or full body. Keep the face prominent, with similar head-to-body proportions to Bram v02. Natural character-appropriate hands/pose, not all the same pose.
Genuine transparent alpha everywhere outside the illustrated silhouette, clean antialiased edges. No colored fog, halo, rectangular background, frame, UI, label, badge, letters, watermark or extra figures.
World: medieval-based fantasy; familiar fantasy adaptations allowed while retaining medieval daily-life materials and atmosphere.

Reference binding override for this NEW character: Input 1 is a SPECIES/STYLE reference ONLY, NOT an existing identity. Design the distinct subject specified below, NOT Bram or Nib or Luka. Input 2 remains Bram style/composition and input 3 Nib drawing style only.
Orcs: broad build, green/olive skin, CLEAR short lower tusks, bone/leather/red earth pigment ornaments, warm communal characters rather than brutality. Each face/expression/clothing must be distinct.
Avoid modern garments, firearms, goggles, plastic, anime eyes, airbrush, photorealism, additional characters, text, card borders, background scenes or halos. Ensure every prop fits with transparent breathing room. Subject wording is authoritative for identity; tiny book/map markings must be abstract ink shapes, no readable text.

Subject: Moga, a gigantic orc lumberjack, huge shoulders filling the frame, wide joyful gap-toothed laugh, small tusks, bald head with red earth paint stripes. Double-bitted axe across the back, a carved wooden tree charm on a cord, sleeveless wool tunic. Both big hands raised in an apologetic shrug as if saying sorry to a tree. Expression: booming warmth.
